# code-solutions

Catalouge of prep questions i've done for interviews, Geeksforgeeks, leetcode & hackerrank
 
I try to do intersting coding questions on my free time to brush up on my alogrithm and data structures knowledge for job interviews 
 
I keep a consolidated log of questions done between my laptop and desktop 

I keep a to-do list of interesting questions seen on youtube
 
Some hard solutions i did not find on my own, but all implementations are my own.
